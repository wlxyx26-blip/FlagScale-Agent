# Hardware Adaptation after Plugin Upgrade

Adapt and fix vllm-plugin-FL for specific hardware backends after each plugin version upgrade. When vLLM bumps its base version (e.g., 0.19 -> 0.20), hardware-specific code paths break because internal APIs shift, new Triton kernels are introduced, or FlagGems op coverage lags.

## Prerequisites

Before starting adaptation, ensure the environment is ready (via `infer-env-setup`):
- SSH connection confirmed
- Docker container running with correct image, device mounts, and workspace volume
- vLLM (CPU-only), vllm-plugin-FL (editable), and FlagGems installed
- All imports verified (`import vllm`, `import vllm_fl`, `import flag_gems`)

## Critical Rules

1. **Test in order**: unit -> functional -> offline inference -> serving. Fix each stage before proceeding.
2. **Never modify vLLM source** -- all patches go through plugin files in `vllm_fl/`.
3. **Stream and persist logs** -- use `2>&1 | tee /workspace/adapt-logs/<stage>.log`.
4. **One patch per failure** -- fix, re-test, then move to the next.
5. **Patches are hardware-gated** -- use `if current_platform.is_<backend>()` or vendor_name check.
6. **Every workaround has a TODO** -- state when it can be removed.
7. **Squash before PR** -- squash all adaptation commits into one clean commit.

---

## Test Progression

Run tests in strict order. Fix all failures at each stage before proceeding to the next.

### Stage 0: Workspace Orientation (MANDATORY)

Before any test, record all paths to memory to avoid path confusion:

```bash
ssh <ssh_host> "docker exec <container> bash -c '
  find /workspace -name vllm_fl -type d 2>/dev/null | head -5 &&
  python3 -c \"import vllm; print(vllm.__version__)\" &&
  python3 -c \"import vllm_fl; print(vllm_fl.__file__)\" &&
  ls -lh /workspace/adapt-logs/ 2>/dev/null | tail -10 &&
  ls -lh /workspace/models/ 2>/dev/null | head -10
'"
```

Immediately record to memory:
```
memory_write('<backend>_plugin_workspace', '<discovered_path>')
memory_write('<backend>_vllm_version', '<version>')
memory_write('<backend>_model_path', '/workspace/models/<model_name>')
```

**Never guess paths. Always read from memory or re-probe.**

### Stage 1: Unit Tests

```bash
ssh <ssh_host> "docker exec <container> bash -c '
  cd /workspace/adapt/<backend>-vllm-<version>/vllm-plugin-FL &&
  VLLM_PLUGINS=fl pytest tests/unit_tests/ -x -v \
  2>&1 | tee /workspace/adapt-logs/unit_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
'"
```

Monitor with `duration=120`, `process_pattern="pytest"`. Unit tests complete in under 60s on most backends; if pytest dies the monitor returns immediately.

Purpose: verify import compatibility, API surface, basic plugin registration.

### Stage 2: Functional Tests

```bash
ssh <ssh_host> "docker exec <container> bash -c '
  cd /workspace/adapt/<backend>-vllm-<version>/vllm-plugin-FL &&
  VLLM_PLUGINS=fl pytest tests/functional_tests/ -x -v \
  2>&1 | tee /workspace/adapt-logs/functional_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
'"
```

Monitor with `duration=300`, `process_pattern="pytest"`, `fail_pattern="FAILED|ERROR|hang|timeout"`. If a test hangs beyond 5 min, kill it and diagnose with `-k <test_name>`.

Purpose: verify operator correctness, kernel dispatch, dtype handling.

### Stage 3: Offline Inference

```bash
ssh <ssh_host> "docker exec <container> bash -c '
  cd /workspace/adapt/<backend>-vllm-<version>/vllm-plugin-FL &&
  VLLM_PLUGINS=fl MODEL_PATH=/workspace/models/<model> TP_SIZE=2 \
  python examples/<model>_offline_inference.py \
  2>&1 | tee /workspace/adapt-logs/offline_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
'"
```

Monitor with `duration=600`, `process_pattern="python"`, `success_pattern="Prompt.*Output:|Generated text:"`. Model loading takes 2-4 min on first run.

Purpose: full model execution without serving overhead. Validates model loading, forward pass, sampling.

### Stage 4: Serving Test

```bash
# Terminal 1: start server
ssh <ssh_host> "docker exec <container> bash -c '
  VLLM_PLUGINS=fl vllm serve /workspace/models/<model> \
  --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
  --trust-remote-code \
  2>&1 | tee /workspace/adapt-logs/serving_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
'"

# Terminal 2: test request (after "Uvicorn running on" appears)
ssh <ssh_host> "docker exec <container> curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{\"model\": \"/workspace/models/<model>\", \"prompt\": \"Hello\", \"max_tokens\": 20}'"
```

Monitor server log with `success_pattern="Uvicorn running on"`, `fail_pattern="Error|Traceback"`.

Purpose: validate the full serving stack under real HTTP load.

## Version-Adaptive Patching

The key principle: **detect first, patch only what's actually missing in the installed version.**

```bash
# Check what API exists before patching
ssh <ssh_host> "docker exec <container> python3 -c \
  'import vllm.worker.worker as w; print(dir(w.Worker))'"
```

**Common breakage patterns and fixes:**

| Breakage | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Worker API change | `AttributeError` on worker init | Update `vllm_fl/worker/<backend>_worker.py` |
| New Triton kernel | `RuntimeError: Triton not supported` | Gate with `if not current_platform.is_<backend>()` |
| FlagGems op missing | `NotImplementedError` for op | Add fallback or report to FlagGems upstream |
| Attention backend change | Wrong attention output | Update `vllm_fl/attention/<backend>_attn.py` |
| Model runner API shift | `TypeError` on runner call | Update `vllm_fl/model_runner/<backend>_runner.py` |
| Platform detection wrong | Device routed to wrong code path | Set `is_cuda_alike()`, `use_custom_allreduce()` correctly in `vllm_fl/platform.py` |
| Patch applied twice | Double-patched function crashes or loops | Add idempotency guard (`_patches_applied` flag) at top of `apply_patches()` |
| `torch.accelerator` API missing | `AttributeError` on `torch.accelerator.*` | Stub missing attrs in `patch.py` with backend-specific equivalents |
| Ops registry conflict | `c10::Error: duplicate op registration` | Pre-load vendor C extension before registering schemas in `_C_ops_registry.py` |
| CUDAGraph capture timeout | Server killed during graph capture | Set `VLLM_EXECUTE_MODEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` to a large value (e.g., 7200) |
| FlagGems fast-path on wrong backend | Wrong output on non-CUDA hardware | Restrict FlagGems-routed ops to `current_platform.is_cuda()` only |
| New MoE dispatch point | `NotImplementedError: invoke_fused_moe_triton_kernel` | Register vendor MoE kernel in `vllm_fl/dispatch/backends/vendor/<backend>/register_ops.py` |

---

## Copy-then-Patch Discipline

1. **Copy first**: `cp <vllm_source>/<file>.py <plugin>/vllm_fl/<path>/<file>.py` -- verbatim, no edits
2. **Patch via targeted edits**: use `edit_file` for specific lines, not `write_file` for the whole file
3. **One category at a time**: group related changes, verify import, then continue
4. **Import check after each batch**: `python3 -c "from vllm_fl.models.X import Y; print('OK')"`
5. **Never rewrite from scratch**: if tempted to rewrite, stop and read more upstream code first

## Stage 5: Clean-Up Checklist

Before squashing commits and opening PR:

### Code Quality
- [ ] No debug `print()` statements left in any file
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks
- [ ] No temporary `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` or similar
- [ ] Every patch has a `# TODO: Remove when ...` comment
- [ ] Patches are gated by platform check (`if current_platform.is_<backend>()`)
- [ ] `git diff main` reviewed -- only necessary changes remain

### Sensitive Content
- [ ] No passwords, tokens, or API keys in code or comments
- [ ] No SSH config, private keys, or `.pem` file paths committed
- [ ] No hardcoded IP addresses or internal hostnames
- [ ] Run `git diff main | grep -iE '(password|token|secret|pem|private_key|proxy)'` -- should return nothing

### Commits & PR
- [ ] All commits squashed into one clean commit
- [ ] Commit message describes all changes with *what* and *why*
- [ ] Commit message includes test results summary
- [ ] Branch name follows convention: `adapt/<backend>-vllm-<version>`
