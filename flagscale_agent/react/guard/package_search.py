"""PackageSearchGuard — prevents blind searching for package/source locations.

When the agent needs to locate a software package or source code, it should
ask the user directly rather than using find/ls/grep to search the filesystem.
This avoids wasted time and incorrect assumptions about which copy is active.

Exception: locating flagscale_agent's own source via python import is allowed.
