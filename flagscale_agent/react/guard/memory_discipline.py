"""MemoryDisciplineGuard — reminds the agent to use memory proactively.

Logic:
- Track tool calls since last memory read/write
- Every 10 calls without memory operation → inject a reminder
- Every 30 calls without memory operation → block (overridable)
- Before TASK_COMPLETE without memory review → inject evolution reminder
- If LLM reads/writes memory, reset counter
