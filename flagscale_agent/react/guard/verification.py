"""VerificationGuard — requires verification evidence when marking steps complete.

Design principles:
- Block plan_update(action="step_done") if no _override_reason provided
- Other tool calls (read_file/shell/grep) are completely unaffected
- LLM can freely perform verification operations after being blocked
- Once verified, LLM calls plan_update(step_done, _override_reason="...") to pass
- Does not check override_reason content — any non-empty reason passes
- Uses existing override mechanism — LLM already knows this pattern

Why this works:
- To pass the block, LLM must write override_reason
- Writing override_reason forces LLM to reflect "how do I know this step is done?"
- The reflection itself improves verification discipline

Execution flow:
1. LLM: plan_update(action="step_done", step_id=3)
2. Guard: BLOCK - verification evidence required

3. LLM: OK, let me verify first
4. LLM: shell("grep '<<<<<<' -r .")  ← executes normally, not blocked
5. LLM: read_file("/path/to/__init__.py")  ← executes normally
6. LLM: shell("python -m py_compile *.py")  ← executes normally

7. LLM: Verified, now I can step_done
8. LLM: plan_update(action="step_done", step_id=3, _override_reason="grep shows no conflicts, files complete, parseable")
9. Guard: Has override_reason, allow ✓
