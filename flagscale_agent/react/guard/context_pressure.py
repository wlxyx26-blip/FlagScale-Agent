"""Context pressure guard — blocks tool calls when context is too full.

Design:
- All detection in check_pre (before tool execution)
- Two paths: evict path (recoverable) and hard_reset path (unrecoverable)
- No inject — only block with clear instructions
- Minimal state: one bool flag (_need_hard_reset)
